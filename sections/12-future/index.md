# Known Issues and Future Work

This section outlines current limitations in the game and possible improvements for future releases.

---

## Known Issues

- The behaviour of the cats can still be improved. Sometimes, multiple cats overlap on the same position in the maze, which reduces clarity and can affect gameplay.
- The graphics and animations are simple and functional, but they could be improved to look visually appealing.

---

## Potential Future Developments

- Introduce more advanced movement logic for the cats, such as non-overlapping movement, or strategic chasing based on Jerry’s location.

- Add new game modes to make gameplay more diverse and challenging.  
  For example, a time-attack mode where players must complete the maze within a set time limit.  
  Another idea is to introduce new types of cheese or collectibles with special effects and bonuses.

- Add a local multiplayer mode where two players can share a keyboard or controller, and possibly support online multiplayer for competitive or cooperative play.

- Replace current assets with higher-resolution sprites, smoother animations, and visual effects (e.g. glowing cheese, animations when items are collected or cats are chased).

- Implement a persistent high-score system so players can track their best scores or compare with others locally or online.

- Improve screen scaling to support various screen resolutions and add accessibility features like colour-blind modes and customizable control.
