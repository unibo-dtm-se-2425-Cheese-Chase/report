# Concept

CheeseChase is a **desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI)**.  
It offers interactive graphics and animations, making it easy and enjoyable to play.  
The game works as a **real-time system**, where the main loop updates the game logic and visuals about **30 times per second**, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay.

From a use case perspective, the players are **casual gamers** who use a desktop or laptop computer.  
They interact with the game continuously during each session, since it is a **fast-paced, arcade-style experience**.  
The main way of interacting is through the **keyboard**:  
- The **arrow keys** move Jerry (the mouse) up, down, left, or right through the maze.  
- The **spacebar** lets the player pause or resume the game at any time.

The game does **not store any permanent data**.  
Information such as the current level, the score, and the number of lives is kept **only in memory** during gameplay.  
Once the game ends or is restarted, all values are reset. No accounts or external storage are required.

There are two main roles in the system:  
- **Player** — controls Jerry and tries to win by collecting cheese and avoiding cats.  
- **System** — runs the background processes: animating characters, checking collisions, updating the score, and enforcing the game rules.
