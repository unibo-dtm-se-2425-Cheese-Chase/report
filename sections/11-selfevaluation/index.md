# Self-evaluation

At the beginning of the project, we collaboratively discussed how to organise the work and divide responsibilities in a balanced and efficient way. Together, we prepared the diagrams and the initial design material before moving into the implementation phase, ensuring a shared understanding of the structure, requirements, and overall direction of the system. As development progressed, our roles evolved naturally according to our individual skills and strengths. This allowed us to work in parallel while remaining coordinated throughout the project.

As the project advanced, I focused primarily on the preparation and refinement of the report, updating it step-by-step in alignment with the system’s development. My work centred on documenting the architecture, describing system behaviour, organising the testing section, and ensuring that each requirement and design decision was clearly and accurately presented.

A key strength in my contribution was maintaining an organised and consistently updated report that always reflected the actual state of the project. I paid particular attention to clarity and completeness, especially when explaining requirements and the MVC structure. At the same time, I encountered some challenges. Understanding certain parts of the code, especially those involving complex interactions between game entities, required extra effort, and producing UML diagrams was initially difficult since it was something I had never done before. Nevertheless, I gradually improved and succeeded in integrating these elements effectively into the documentation.

Overall, my contribution aligned well with the project’s needs. I ensured that the report remained coherent, accurate, and continuously refined, providing documentation that complemented and supported Francesca’s development work.

## Francesca

Throughout the project, I was responsible for implementing the full codebase of the game. I designed and developed all core components, taking inspiration from publicly available Pac-Man-style implementations and adapting them to meet our specific requirements. This included defining the architecture, implementing gameplay mechanics, managing interactions between entities, and ensuring smooth integration across the model, controller, and view layers. I also handled all technical problem-solving tasks, including debugging, refactoring, and overall optimisation to maintain clean and modular code consistent with the MVC structure.

Overall, I consider my contribution substantial and well executed. The work required significant effort and dedication, but it allowed me to apply and strengthen my programming skills in a practical and challenging context. I am satisfied with the quality and completeness of the implementation, while fully recognising that the system could be further expanded or refined in future iterations.
